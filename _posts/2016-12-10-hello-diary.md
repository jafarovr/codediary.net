Hello Everyone,

This blog is going to be list of articles which I find very useful when I look for them. Often I find some articles/tutorials/piece of code very useful, I bookmark them, but later either the link does not work or I can't find what I am looking for. In this Code Diary blog I am going to publish these articles, so that I personally can access them easily.

I will also follow the tutorial step by step, make sure that the tutorial works, so if you have any difficulties feel free to leave a comment, I will try to reply as soon as possible. I hope the blog will be useful for you.

Happy coding!
