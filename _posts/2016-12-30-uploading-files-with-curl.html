<p>I&rsquo;ve always trouble uploading files with Curl. Some how the syntax for that command won&rsquo;t stick, so I post it here for future reference.</p>
<p>What I want to do is perform a normal <code>POST</code>, including a file and some other variables to a remote server. This is it:</p>
<pre>curl -i -F name=test -F filedata=@localfile.jpg http://example.org/upload
</pre>
<p>You can add as many <code>-F</code> as you want. The <code>-i</code> option tells curl to show the response headers as well, which I find useful most of the time.</p>
