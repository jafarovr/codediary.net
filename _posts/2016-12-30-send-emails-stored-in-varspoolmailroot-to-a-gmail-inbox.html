<p>Typically a lot of scripts, cron jobs and such will generate output that gets send by email to the operator. The only guaranteed operator account to exists on all Linux/Unix boxes is root, so that becomes the default mail recipient.</p>

<p>The same holds for email that bounces and can't get delivered.</p>
<p>Typically the administrator will configure the system to forward mail addressed to root to an user acount (locally or remote). The default is via <code>/etc/aliases</code></p>
<pre class=""># Basic system aliases -- these MUST be present.
mailer-daemon:  postmaster
postmaster:     root
# Forward all mail to root to the email
root:           your@email.com
</pre>
<p>If your VPS comes with sendmail you need to run <code>newaliases</code> to activate the changes.</p>
<p>To route email you need DNS so start by confuguring DNS. Edit <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and add the following lines:</p>
<pre class=""># /etc/resolv.conf
# Use Google's public DNS servers
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 8.8.8.8
</pre>
<p>Often this is already sufficient to send email.</p>
