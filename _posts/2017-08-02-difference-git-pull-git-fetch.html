<p>In the simplest terms,&nbsp;<code>git pull</code>&nbsp;does a&nbsp;<code>git fetch</code>&nbsp;followed by a&nbsp;<code>git merge</code>.</p>
<p>You can do a&nbsp;<code>git fetch</code>&nbsp;at any time to update your remote-tracking branches under&nbsp;<code>refs/remotes/<remote>/</code>.</p>
<p>This operation never changes any of your own local branches under&nbsp;<code>refs/heads</code>, and is safe to do without changing your working copy. I have even heard of people running&nbsp;<code>git fetch</code>periodically in a cron job in the background (although I wouldn't recommend doing this).</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<code>git pull</code>&nbsp;is what you would do to bring a local branch up-to-date with its remote version, while also updating your other remote-tracking branches.</p>
