<p>If you don't have access to configure Apache, you can still send the header from a PHP script. It's a case of adding the following to your PHP scripts:</p>
<pre class="lang:php decode:true code "> <?php
 header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
</pre>
<div class="container">
<section>
<p class="note">Note: as with all uses of the PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php">header function</a>, this must be before any output has been sent from the server.</p>
</section>
</div>
