<p>Sometime when you have two network interfaces (say <code>eth0</code> and <code>eth1</code>) on the client and for some reason there is a need to SSH to the server over a specific a specific interface. By default the primary interface will be used. To use eth1 we just need to add a route:</p>
<pre>route add -net 10.75.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.1 eth1</pre>
<p>The route is removed upon reboot. Use -p to&nbsp;permanently add&nbsp;the route to the table. To delete the route:</p>
<pre>route del -net 10.75.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.1 eth1</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
