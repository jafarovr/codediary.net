<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>This blog is going to be list of articles which I find very useful when I look for them. Often I find some articles/tutorials/piece of code very useful, I bookmark them, but later either the link does not work or I can't find what I am looking for. In this Code Diary blog I am going to publish these articles, so that I personally can access them easily.</p>
<p>I will also follow the tutorial step by step, make sure that the tutorial <strong>works</strong>, so if you have any difficulties feel free to leave a comment, I will try to reply as soon as possible. I hope the blog will be useful for you.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
