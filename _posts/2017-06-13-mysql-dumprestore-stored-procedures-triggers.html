<p><code>mysqldump</code> will backup by default all the triggers but NOT the stored procedures/functions. There are 2 mysqldump parameters that control this behavior:</p>
<p>&mdash;routines &ndash; FALSE by default<br />
&mdash;triggers &ndash; TRUE by default</p>
<p>This means that if you want to include in an existing backup script also the triggers and stored procedures you only need to add the &mdash;routines command line parameter:</p>
<pre>mysqldump <other mysqldump options> --routines outputfile.sql</pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume we want to backup ONLY the stored procedures and triggers and not the mysql tables and data (this can be useful to import these in another db/server that has already the data but not the stored procedures and/or triggers), then we should run something like:</p>
<pre>mysqldump --routines --no-create-info --no-data --no-create-db --skip-opt <database> > outputfile.sql</pre>
<p>and this will save only the procedures/functions/triggers of the . If you need to import them to another db/server you will have to run something like:</p>
<pre>mysql <database> < outputfile.sql</pre>
