<p>In Unix and Unix-like systems (like Ubuntu), archiving and compression are separate.</p>
<p><code>tar</code> puts multiple files into a single (tar) file.</p>
<p><code>gzip</code> compresses one file (only).</p>
<p>So to get a compressed archive, you combine the two, first use <code>tar</code> or <code>pax</code> to get all files into a single file (archive.tar), then <code>gzip</code> it (archive.tar.gz). If you only have one file you need to compress (notes.txt), there's no need for tar, so you just do <code>gzip notes.txt</code> which will result in <code>notes.txt.gz</code>. There are other types of compression, such as <code>compress</code>, <code>bzip2</code> and <code>xz</code> which work in the same manner as gzip (apart from using different types of compression of course)</p>
