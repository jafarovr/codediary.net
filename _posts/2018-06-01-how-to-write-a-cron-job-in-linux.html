<h4>What is a Cron Job?</h4>
<p>Cron is a Linux utility where you can setup a task in your machine to run automatically, if required in a repetitive manner at a specific time and date.<br />
Such a task that you schedule is called a Cron Job.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here we'll look into how we can setup a cron job in a Linux machine.</p>
<p>Follow the steps bellow.</p>
<h6>Step 1 :</h6>
<p>Place the script you want to schedule as a Cron Job to one of the following directories in your machine depending on how often you need to repeat the execution of the script.</p>
<pre>/etc/cron.hourly
/etc/cron.daily
/etc/cron.weekly
/etc/cron.monthly</pre>
<p>For example, if you want to schedule your task daily, place the script in the <code>/etc/cron.daily</code> directory.</p>
<h6>Step 2 :</h6>
<p>Then give correct permissions to the script as follows. Assume <code>script.sh</code> is the script that you need to schedule.</p>
<pre>cd /etc/cron.daily
chmod 755 script.sh</pre>
<h6>Step 3:</h6>
<p>Then you should add a new Cron Job to crontab.</p>
<pre>crontab -e</pre>
<h6>Step 4 :</h6>
<p>Then you will be prompted with your vi editor in the terminal. Type in the following into the editor and to save it hit ESC key, and then type <code>:w</code> followed by <code>:q</code> to exit.</p>
<pre>0 0 * * * /etc/cron.daily/script.sh</pre>
<p>This command will make the Cron Job run every night.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Look at the following to identify the different ways of customizing the command given in Step 4.</p>
