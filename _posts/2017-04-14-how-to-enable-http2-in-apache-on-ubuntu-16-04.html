<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple guide showing how you can enable HTTP/2 in Apache on Ubuntu 16.04.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s internet connections are amazingly fast. You younglings might not believe this, but there was a time when we actually had to sit and wait for a website to appear. If you want to experience the internet speeds of the past, give <a href="http://www.56k-emulator.co.uk/" rel="external">56k Emulator</a> a try. It will give you the basic idea. And keep in mind that 56K modems were freakin&rsquo; fast when they became available.</p>
<p>Even though today&rsquo;s internet connections are fast, the technology used to push propaganda around inside the tubes is old and slow. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" rel="external">HTTP/1.1</a> was never intended to be used with the kind of content-heavy website we have today. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a new option available, the marvelous <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540" rel="external">RFC-7540</a>. Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2" rel="external">HTTP/2</a>, if you will.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>HTTP/2 is a major revision of HTTP/1.1. Its main goal is to make web sites appear in your browser quicker, and with the need to send less data than with HTTP/1.1. The &ldquo;number one HTTP server on the internet&rdquo;, <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" rel="external">Apache 2</a> only has <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_http2.html">experimental support</a> for HTTP/2. This means that it&rsquo;s not available in the version Ubuntu 16.04 includes by default.</p>
<p>Once again, we have to turn to our PPA packaging hero <a href="https://www.sury.org/" rel="external">Ond≈ôej Sur&yacute;</a> for support. Not only does he maintain packages for the latest and greatest version of PHP (that we used <a href="https://www.vegard.net/archives/14100/">here</a>), he also makes sure Ubuntu users can be on the bleeding edge of Apache goodness.</p>
<h2>Getting on the HTTP/2 Highway</h2>
<div class="alert alert-warning">These instructions assume that you&rsquo;ve already got Apache2 installed, and that the sites you want to enable HTTP/2 for has TLS (HTTPS) enabled. If you don&rsquo;t, and have no idea how to do this, please consult the internet. Log in to your Ubuntu box (if you&rsquo;re doing it over SSH, your account is of course <a href="https://www.vegard.net/archives/14282/">secured with 2FA</a>). Then, run the following commands:</div>
<div class="wp_syntax"></div>
<pre class="wp_syntax"># Install add-apt-repository. 
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common 

# Add Sur&yacute;'s Apache2 PPA repository. 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/apache2 

# Update your local package list. 
sudo apt-get update 

# Upgrade Apache2 with the new packages from Sur&yacute;. 
sudo apt-get upgrade</pre>
<p>Next, enable HTTP/2.</p>
<pre class="bash">sudo a2enmod http2</pre>
<p>Then, add the Protocols directive to the VirtualHost configuration of the sites you want to server over HTTP/2:</p>
<pre class="wp_syntax"><VirtualHost *:443> 
  ServerName your-awesome-site.com 
  Protocols h2 http/1.1 
</VirtualHost></pre>
<p>Finally, restart Apache2.</p>
<pre class="wp_syntax"># Restart Apache2. 
sudo service apache2 restart</pre>
<p>All done. Your site is now being server using HTTP/2. Hooray!</p>
